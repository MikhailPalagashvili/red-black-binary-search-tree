# red-black-binary-search-tree
red black binary search tree implementation 
Implementation of red black binary search tree.
It is a particular implementation of a self-balancing binary search tree
Each node of the binary tree has an extra bit, and that bit is often interpreted as the color (red or black) of the node.
These color bits are used to ensure the tree remains approximately balanced during insertions and deletions.
No prerequisites or installations are required to create this project.
